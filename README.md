smooks-play2-xml-to-jpa
=======================

Simple smooks and play2 example application which converts xml sax event stream to jpa classes

This example is heavily reusing example application from Smooks 1.5.1

https://github.com/smooks/smooks/tree/v1.5.1/smooks-examples/xml-to-java

It is basically put up to show how java object model is to be transformed to JPA model and
 how it can be persisted to H2 database without too much complications.
